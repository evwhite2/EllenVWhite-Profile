                <h3> About Me</h3>

                <p>
                     As an aspiring full stack developer currently enrolled in the Northwestern Full-Stack Bootcamp, I am working to move the trajectory of my career towards a tech company with a conscious.
                </p>
                <p>
                     I earned a Bacherlor's of Arts and Science in Earth, Society, and Envrionmental Science and Sustainability from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (yes, it's a mouth full), and I am currently on course to complete my Masters in Business Adminstration with a concentration in Database Management from Loyola University Chicago by 2021. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previous to the bootcamp, I have contributed to the design and implementation of small-scale data tools to help a former employer make more effective choices on a front-line basis. With several years of advanced customer service experience in leadership roles throughout university and into my young professional career, I have enjoyed and exceled in having an active line of communication with clients, while also maintaining an effective yet flexible leadership style. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been inclined towards the principles of continuous improvement, and plans to use my fresh experience with the many suites learned in Bootcamp to do just that. While my long term goal is to dig into the development of data managment applications, I also life-long obsession with art and design that is both practiced and preached. That being considered, I truly love being able to work throughout the full stack, as I find the exacting work it take to build on visual design and UI very gratifying. 
                </p>
