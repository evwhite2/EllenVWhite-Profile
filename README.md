# responsive-portfolio

Welcome to my new and improved Webpage thanks to the help of Bootstrap! 

Not everything is fully functional quite yet (namely the contact form, which looks pretty, but doesn't yet send information anywhere), but I believe it does its primary job of displaying information in a fun and functional way. 

Bootstrap classes were heavily utilized in this site, for almost every object on the page, but I customize part of almost evert element to meet my desired aesthetic. Bootstrap's "grid" layout mechanism was used on all three pages found on the navigation bar at the top of the display, most notable on the "Portfolio" page.

The “Portfolio” page also now features clickable links, which at this time do not lead anywhere, but can be easily updated to include live links once I actually have multiple presentable sites and other portfolio works to display. I used Bootstrap image tags to stylize my photos, with rounded edges, but layered a block of text on top with my anchor tags for to clarify the photos are meant to function as links. I also wrapped each photo in a <div> of my own design to control the size and alignment of the stock photos.

Bootstrap "cards" were nested into the grid on the main "About Me" page to create a more dynamic-looking main page. While their design is all build by Bootstrap, I updated the classes inside the existing code to match the aesthetic of other elements on the page. Their content is just bland text for now but could be customize in the future to include more interactive content.

Lastly, the form location on the “Contact” page was also borrowed from Bootstrap. I decided to use their “controlled” form classes, and laid the (currently non-functional) contact form in a grid alongside additional contact links, which now also have corresponding icons for the links sites.
    
Hope you enjoy!
