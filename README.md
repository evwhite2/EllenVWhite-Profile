# responsive-portfolio

Welcome to my site!

Site is now undergoing changes to include a few small animations I've learned using some vanilla JavaScript. 

My "Portfolio" page now includes links to my projects, and will continue to grow.

The "Contact Me" page now also works to open up an email client and auto-fill a new message upon clicking "submit". This will be updating to submit a real form seamlessless within a few weeks.

Lastly, a link to my updated Resume can now be found on the navigation bar.


Enjoy. :)


P.S. If you're interested in my art, find my blog here: (Yes I realize it's sacrilegious for a developer to use WordPress for thier own portfolio, I promise I will build my own site in time)
