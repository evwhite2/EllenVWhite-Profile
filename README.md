# EllenVWhite-Portfolio

Welcome to my site! 

Now deployed on Heroku at https://rocky-shore-56003.herokuapp.com/ 

Site is continuously ungoing changes as I learn and build more projects. 

Portfolio has been updated to include my most recent full-stack group project: TripBuddy, be sure to check it out.

The contact form now send an email directly to me for any inquiries through my site. 

There are also a few styling updates, but nothing too noticable for now.

Lastly, a link to my updated Resume can now be found on the navigation bar.


Enjoy. :)


P.S. If you're interested in my art, find my blog here: (Yes I realize it's sacrilegious for a developer to use WordPress for thier own portfolio, I promise I will build my own site in time)
