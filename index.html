                <h3> About Me</h3>

                <p>
                     As an aspiring full stack developer currently enrolled in the Northwestern Full-Stack Bootcamp, Ellen White is working to move the trajectory of her career towards a tech company with a conscious. She has a Bacherlor's of Arts and Science in Earth, Society, and Envrionmental Sustainability from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and is on course to complete her Masters in Business Adminstration with a concentration in Technological Support and a certificate in Database Management from Loyola University Chicago by 2021. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previous to the bootcamp, she has contributed to the design and implementation of small-scale data tools to help a former employer make more effective choices on a front-line basis. With several years of advanced customer service experience in leadership roles, she has enjoyed and exceled in having an active line of communication with clients, providing the ideal combination of flexibility, emotional intelligence, and diligence to quickly and reliably. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She has always been inclined towards the principles of continuous improvement, and plans to use her fresh experience with the many suites we will learn in Bootcamp to do just that. The cherry on top is her life-long obsession with art and design that is both practiced and preached to the delight of all those who observe.
